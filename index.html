        <p>I am an aspiring model, and learning web developer.</p>

        <h2 class="titles">Work History</h2>

        <p>For most of my working life I have been a part of Customer Service of all kinds.
        I have been a cashier with a pizza place called Papa Murphy's, I have worked as a busser,
        take out, and as a server/bartender for a pizza restaraunt called Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza.
        Now I work customer service for a mom and pop Pharmacy, called Bill's Prescription Center, where I live in Brandon Florida.

        <h2 class="titles">Places I have Lived</h2>

        <p>I used to live on the West side of America, in California. I have lived both in South and North California.
        Los Angeles for ten years and then Vallejo for eight years. It wasn't til I was eighteen that I finally moved to Florida.
        I even lived in Washington DC Proper for a time with my cousin Timothy.
